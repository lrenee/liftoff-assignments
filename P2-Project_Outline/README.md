# Project Outline

## Overview

I am a perfectionist, a completionist, and I have a few OCD 
tendencies.  As a result, I definitely plan to finish what 
I start, and aim for absolute perfection, with no shortcuts.  Sometimes, the combination of these personality traits can make 
life a bit difficult, especially when I come across items that
are hard to obtain, but required to complete a goal.

As an illustration of this issue, a few years ago I started 
cooking my way through a Weight Watcher's cookbook, beginning 
with the very first recipe.  Occasionally, I have found my 
progress stagnated by hard to find ingredients (such as 
Romanesco broccoli, Scotch bonnet peppers, and huckleberries, 
to name a few.)  In order to solve this problem, I decided to
create an application that will help locate and spread the cost
of such difficult to find items.

My application will provide a space for individuals located 
within the same community to come together to harness the 
buying power of a larger group / bulk purchase.  I have found 
myself in a position where there is something that I want to 
buy, but the item is only available in larger quantities than 
I personally need.  There is both a physical merchandise 
component to this problem, as well as an experiential 
component.  Examples of the physical merchandise side include 
Hanukkah cookies, mini Rubik's cubes (Alibaba.com), and 
huckleberries (limited availability to the Northwest, with 
Amazon.com selling a 3-gallon bucket).  Examples of the 
experiential component include box seats (such as to the 
Kentucky Derby, a concert, or a playoff game), a premier wine 
tasting (such as a bottle of Dom Perignon and / or Chateau 
Margaux), and chartering a private jet.

The first step / MVP will be to provide a discussion forum for 
users to connect and post their wants / needs / ideas.  The 
next step will be to create a link to various websites to 
detail specific purchasing opportunities.  Also, since the 
idea is to have individuals share an item or an experience, 
there would be a geographical component to this site.  Finally, 
in order to truly harness the buying power of the group, the 
final step would be to include a strategy / protocol of the 
exchange of money / goods.

This application should help to solve the issue of obtaining
hard to find ingredients / products and experiences.

## Features

###Phase 1 (MVP):

####User Login:
Users will be able to create accounts and log in to the 
application.  Password Authentication and User Authorization 
will be performed.

####Key Word Search
Users will be able to search existing posts for specific text 
phrases.

####Create Discussion Thread
Users will be able to create a new discussion thread.
 
####Reply to Existing Post
Users will be able to add a comment to an existing thread.

####Modify Discussion Thread
Users will be able to edit their own comments within 
discussion threads.

####Delete Comments / Empty Discussion Threads
Users will be able to delete their own comments within a 
discussion thread.  Users will also be able to delete an 
entire discussion thread, as long as they are the creator 
and sole contributor to the discussion thread.

###Phase 2:

####Geographical Location Features
Users will be able to specify geographic range for inclusion 
in a discussion thread.

####Link to Other Websites
Users will be able to upload a link to an existing website 
featuring the product / experience they are seeking.

###Phase 3:

####Harness Buying Power
My application will include a strategy / protocol for 
exchange of money / goods, enabling users to financially 
contribute to the acquisition cost of the desired good / 
service.
