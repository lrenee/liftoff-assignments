# Project Outline

### Overview

My application will provide a space for individuals located within the same community to come together to harness the buying power of a larger group / bulk purchase.
I have found myself in a position where there is something that I want to buy, but the item is only available in larger quantities than I personally need.
There is both a physical merchandise component to this problem, as well as an experiential component.
Examples of the physical merchandise side include Hanukkah cookies, mini Rubik's cubes (Alibaba.com), and huckleberries (limited availability to the Northwest, with Amazon.com selling a 3-gallon bucket).
Examples of the experiential component include box seats (such as to the Kentucky Derby, a concert, or a playoff game), a premier wine tasting (such as a bottle of Dom Perignon and / or Chateau Margaux), and chartering a private jet.

The first step / MVP will be to provide a discussion forum for users to connect and post their wants / needs / ideas.
The next step will be to create a link to various websites to detail specific purchasing opportunities.  Also, since the idea is to have individuals share an item or an experience, there would be a geographical component to this site.
Finally, in order to truly harness the buying power of the group, the final step would be to include a strategy / protocol of the exchange of money / goods.
